# Godot Sandbox (2D)

Experimenting with Godot Engine to explore its capabilities and features. This project is a sandbox for learning various game development concepts using Godot.

## Game Overview: Survival Waves

A 2D survival game where players must fend off waves of increasingly difficult enemies. The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score,
battling through multiple waves of foes that grow stronger with each round.

This project is inspired by the classic game [Superfighters](https://www.y8.com/games/superfighters), one of my favourite childhood games.
